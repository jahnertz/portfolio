## **Paraiso** was a regular music event held in bars, clubs and venues around Makati. The event featured live music, DJs, experimental live visuals and food vendors.

## I developed Paraiso's distinct visual style and designed online and guerilla advertising materials. I also created printed merchandise for the event, as well as performing live visuals and light programming.
