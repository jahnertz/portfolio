## From 2020 through 2021, I led Eventscape & Echochannels' combined design departments to deliver materials for marketing services to regional scale clients. My department produced digital and print collaterals, as well as 3D designs for onground executions. We took advantage of the changed working environment to deliver novel solutions for virtual events not before seen in the region.

## **Reinvent the Rules** was the announcement campaign of the merging of services between [Eventscape Manila](https://www.eventscapemanila.com/) and [Echochannels]() in Mid-2020. I designed the look of the campaign, and produced illustrations and layouts for use in digital ads and on social media.
