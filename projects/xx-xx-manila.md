## As creative director, I was responsible for the venue's promotional graphics and event branding down to the lighting and visuals. I also oversaw XX XX's web and social presence as part of a creative management team.

## Of the many events at XX XX that I developed brand character for, a few notable examples are:

# Circus
## A monthly mini-festival event bringing together live music, performers, visual artists and food pop-ups.
