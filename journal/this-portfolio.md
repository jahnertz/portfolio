This portfolio has been a long time in the making. I secured by first job in the Philippines with a portfolio site I built over a week in 2015 while saying in a 20 Ringgit hotel room in Sibu, Sarawak. That site was built in [Grav](getgrav.org "Grav"), which I chose over Wordpress, because it didn't require a database. I made a yearly saving of about $50 by doing that and figured I could build websites while traveling to the kinds of expat bums I'd met during my previous trip through Southeast Asia.

This site is built on top of a Gridsome starter from [Forestry.io](), and is deployed using [Netlify](app.netlify.com "Netlify"). It's a serverless setup where I don't pay for anything except the domain name.
